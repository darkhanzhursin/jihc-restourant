A magical and enchanted place, a restaurant with a terrace created inside a natural cave. The Grotta Palazzese restaurant takes its name from the homonymous cave and from the place that was once also called "Grotta di Palazzo". 

It is an exclusive and atmospheric place, used for parties and banquets since 1700, as evidenced by a watercolor of 1783 by Jean Louis Desprez. The blue of the sea and the sky contrasts with the mysterious atmospheres of the natural cavities.
